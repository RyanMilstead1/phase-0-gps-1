What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

I was not struggling with the concepts, but I do make occasional syntax errors here and there.

What concepts were clarified during the GPS?

-I did not have full understanding of the fetch and merge commands has I haven't used those prior to this gps.

What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?

-I asked about the pair's well being and learned about his guide style (chill and relaxed)

What still confuses you about Git?

-I am pretty comfortable about Git in terms of what we learned so far.


How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?

-It was great! Ryan was helpful enough to provide hints but didn't reveal too much that I couldn't learn from what I was doing. The communication was also pretty back and forth so both people were on track the entire time.
